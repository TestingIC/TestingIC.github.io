        <h1>Because people are dying.</h1>
        <h2>Because I've done the same</h2>
        <h3>Because this problem is a silent giant</h3>
        <h4>Because I want to help</h4>
        <h5>Because this isn't my problem, it's everyones proglem</h5>
        <h6>Because we all need to talk about what isn't easy to talk about</h6>
        
        <p>In 8th grade I made the decision to come to Rogers Highschool. This isn't what my peers chose. I am the only one who came to Rogers in my grade. This meant abandoning all my friends which did put me into a depression. In the 3rd quarter of 8th grade I did try to commit suicide. I did try for an escape but I couldn't bring myself to. I admit this to show you that no matter who you think you know, their history could be as dark as this topic.</p>
    
        <h3>Finally, I made this because of the person I care the most for. Because I couldn't stand to see her hurt nor anyone else which is why I created this website. To educate <br>
