            <h2>So my name's Isaac Cardello (And the cat on the far left hand side is named Mini). I'm currently a junior at Rogers High School even though I'm currently doing the high schooling part at home because of a pandemic going on outside. Anyways, I'm a country bumpkin who enjoys computer science but more specifically making video games which encompass varying fields of computer science!</h2>
            <h3>As for next year, I plan to move onto AOIT 3 where I'll be expanding my knowledge in <a href = "https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>.</h3>
