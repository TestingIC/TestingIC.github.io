            <h2>My name is Isaac Cardello (and the cat on the far left hand side is named Mini). I'm a junior at Rogers High School. I'm currently doing the high schooling part at home because of a pandemic going on outside. Anyways, I'm a country bumpkin who enjoys computer science, specifically making video games which involve level design, creating pixel-art, and programming.</h2>
