            <h1>If you read my summary from APCSP then you will know I took APCS as sophomore, with little knowledge of programming looking back on it now. Anyways, in APCS I learned the ins and outs of Java. Unlike in APCSP where JS was briedly skimmed over, APCS went into detail from the basics about how to declare variables in Java, all the way to properly code with constructs like OOP.</h1>
